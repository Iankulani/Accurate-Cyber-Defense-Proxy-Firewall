Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Proxy-Firewall is a next-generation network security solution designed to provide intelligent, real-time protection against suspicious and malicious activities
Built with advanced proxy filtering technology, it acts as a secure barrier between your internal network and external connections, inspecting all inbound and outbound traffic with precision.

What sets this firewall apart is its Telegram alert integration. Whenever unusual network traffic patterns are detected—such as sudden data spikes, unauthorized access attempts, 
or abnormal connection requests—the system instantly sends a detailed alert to the network administrator’s Telegram account. 
This ensures rapid incident awareness and faster decision-making, even when the admin is away from the control room.

The Proxy Firewall’s robust architecture supports deep packet inspection (DPI), IP filtering, URL blocking, and intrusion detection. 
It also offers flexible configuration options to suit different environments, from small businesses to large enterprises. 
Its logging and reporting capabilities provide valuable insights for security audits and threat analysis.

By combining strong access control, intelligent traffic monitoring, and instant communication through Telegram, 
the Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Proxy-Firewall empowers organizations to detect and respond to threats before they escalate—ensuring maximum uptime, 
data integrity, and network resilience in an increasingly hostile cyber landscape.
